# MEMORY CONTROL

## Why we must know Memory Control
When we write code and launch program, Computer is used to specific allocate of memory.
In order to handle our memory area, we must know code memory, static memory, stack memory, heap memory.
<br>
---------------------------
## 1. Code memory
- Code memory is area. This area have program code. Code memory save the program code.

## 2. Static memory
- Static memory have global objcet and static object area. When program shutdown, All of object is deleted.

## 3. Stack memory
- Stack memory have local variable, parameter. From this concept comes stack.
- When we called function, system push the local variable, parameter in stack memory.
- And then shutdown the func, stack pop(delete) it.
- Stack memory called complie-time memory.
## 4. Heap memory
- This concept is very important.
- Heap memory concept use the pointer.
